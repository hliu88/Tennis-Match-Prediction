# Tennis-Match-Prediction

#### Project report and Python Notebook codes are located in this root directory

 - `paper.pdf`
 - `tennis_match_prediction.ipynb`

#### Backend API server can be found in the app directory

  - Visit `https://tennis-api.herokuapp.com/` for the API server

#### Frontend React server can be found in the `tennis-front` submodule directory

  - Visit `https://tennis-heroku.herokuapp.com/` for the frontend server

Both servers may be offline due to inactivity resource management by Heroku, 
to start, load the backend API first until Swagger UI appears, then open the 
frontend server and the website will make API calls and display results once 
response is received. Refresh frontend website if data does not show up after
a while and backend has been booted up.
